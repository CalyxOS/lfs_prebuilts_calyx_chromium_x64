Otherwise I am not sure how without using different package names and referring to different product packages for arm64 vs x86_64.",

That would look like this, if adapted for this situation:\n\n```\nprebuilts/calyx/chromium/   # formerly prebuilts/calyx/chromium/arm64/\n  Android.bp   # which references x86_64/[...].apk for that arch\n  SystemWebViewShell.apk\n  TrichromeLibrary6432.apk\n  TrichromeWebView6432.apk\n  universal.apk\n\nprebuilts/calyx/chromium/x86_64/   # subdir of above\n  SystemWebViewShell.apk\n  TrichromeLibrary6432.apk\n  TrichromeWebView6432.apk\n  universal.apk \n```\n\n(Side note, maybe SystemWebViewShell.apk and universal.apk wouldn\u0027t differ between variants.)",
